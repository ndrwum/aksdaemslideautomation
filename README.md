# Automated Church Presentation Slides

This Google Apps Script creates weekly church slides by pulling data from Google Sheets and web sources so you donâ€™t have to copy-paste each week.

## Motivation

Church staff used to build slides by hand which took time and often led to mistakes. This script helps by fetching scriptures, hymns and duties automatically so volunteers can focus on other work.

## Features

It connects to Google Sheets to pull assignments and hymn numbers then scrapes verse text and lyrics online and adds everything to a Google Slides template.

## How It Works

The script reads your Google Sheet with service details then grabs scripture text and hymn lyrics from the web and updates your Slides template with this data.

## Technologies Used

Built with Google Apps Script using Slides and Sheets API plus simple web scraping.

## Setup

Clone this repo or add the script to your Slides project then link your Google Sheet and configure the API or website endpoints you want to use.
